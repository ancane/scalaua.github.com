The Bristol [Formal Methods Seminar] is aimed at teaching new postgraduates some
of the formal methods used in much of modern philosophy. During the first term
we've concentrated on logic: thus far the sessions have covered introductory set
theory, basic metatheorems of first order logic, and the incompleteness of
arithmetic. Next up are modal and temporal logic, while after Easter the focus
will shift to formal epistemology and decision theory.

Many of the handouts from these seminars have now been made available on the
Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy's website, in their section on
[learning mathematical philosophy]. In particular, they have my handout on the
[compactness and Löwenheim--Skolem theorems].

Since the Formal Methods Seminar isn't a full-on logic course, I didn't have
time to cover all of the material I would have liked to, and consequently the
handout is somewhat incomplete. In particular the downwards Löwenheim--Skolem
theorem is not proved, although of course the proof is available in any good
logic textbook. I hope to correct this omission at some point, and if anyone has
corrections or suggestions, please do [email me](mailto:benedict@eastaugh.net).
