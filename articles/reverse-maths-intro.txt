An introduction to reverse mathematics

In December I gave a presentation on [reverse mathematics] to the local logic
seminar. Having neglected this site for so long, it seemed like a good idea to
publish [my handout] from the presentation here. Here's a teaser:

> In ordinary mathematical practice, mathematicians prove theorems, reasoning
> from a fixed set of axioms to a logically derivable conclusion. The axioms in
> play are usually implicit: mathematicians are not generally in the habit of
> asserting at the beginning of their papers that they assume ZFC. Given a
> particular proof, we might reasonably ask which axioms were employed, making
> explicit the author's assumptions.
>
> Now that we have a set of axioms $\Gamma$ which are sufficient to prove some
> theorem $\varphi$, we could further inquire whether or not they are
> _necessary_ to prove the theorem, or whether a strictly weaker set of axioms
> would suffice. To a first approximation, reverse mathematics is the programme
> of discovering precisely which axioms are both necessary and sufficient to
> prove any given theorem of ordinary mathematics.
>
> Expanding on this slightly, in reverse mathematics we calibrate the
> proof-theoretic strength of theorems of ordinary mathematics by proving
> equivalences between those theorems and systems of axioms in a hierarchy of
> known strength. This characterisation should provoke at least three immediate
> questions. Which hierarchy of systems? How do these equivalence proofs work?
> And just what is "ordinary mathematics"?

For the answers to these questions, and many more, you can read my [introduction
to reverse mathematics]. If you notice any mistakes, please drop me a line via
[email] or [Twitter].

A note for the eagle-eyed: at one point I claim that an equivalence between
$\mathsf{ACA}_0$ and some statement $\varphi$ would have to involve a theorem
scheme, and thus cannot be formalised at the level of the object language.
However, the latter does not strictly follow from the former, as
$\mathsf{ACA}_0$ is finitely axiomatisable. For more details on this, read Peter
Smith's [handy little guide] to finitely axiomatising $\mathsf{ACA}_0$.
