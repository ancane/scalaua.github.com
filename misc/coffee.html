        <p>There are probably worse cities in the UK for coffee than Bristol, but it’s not London by any stretch of the imagination. Over the last few years a number of fantastic new coffee shops and suppliers have sprung up there, nicely complementing old stagers like <a href="http://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk">Monmouth</a>.</p>
<p>I have a subscription to <a href="http://hasbean.co.uk">Has Bean</a> which means I get a new pack of their excellent filter coffee every month. The variety is fantastic, since they select a new roast every time. Obviously 250g of coffee doesn’t last that long if you drink a mug or two every day, so I supplement it with visits to Bristol’s own <a href="http://coffeegeek.com/forums/worldregional/uk/338478">Two Day Coffee Roasters</a>. Another good online option is <a href="http://www.squaremilecoffee.com/">Square Mile Coffee</a>; they supply the enjoyable <a href="http://twitter.com/storestespresso">Store St. Espresso</a>.</p>
<p>Currently I’m mostly drinking filter coffee, which I make with a <a href="http://coffeegeek.com/reviews/drip/hario_drip_coffee_pot">Hario drip pot</a>, but when I feel like something stronger I bust out my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot">stovetop</a>. One day I’d like to own a real espresso machine, and I’ve occasionally pondered building one as an engineering project.</p>
<p>When I’m in London I try to find time to go to at least one of Monmouth, <a href="http://www.tappedandpacked.co.uk">Tapped &amp; Packed</a> and <a href="http://www.fernandezandwells.com/">Fernandez &amp; Wells</a>. The Monmouth espresso blend is particularly good; when I worked in the area, I used to go to their Borough Market shop a couple of times a week and get a flat white. Tasting the variations in the blend over time was fascinating.</p>
