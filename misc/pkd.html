    <h1>Philip K. Dick</h1>

    <section class="content">
        <p>I was first introduced to Philip K. Dick through his short stories, and I remember reading <em>The Man in the High Castle</em> when I was fourteen or so. It made quite an impression on me; I have been a fan of his work ever since.</p>
<p>A few years ago, after reading Emmanual Carré’s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/jun/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview15">biography</a> of Dick, I decided to read all of his novels. A quick scan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography_of_Philip_K._Dick">his bibliography</a> revealed that this would not be possible: several of his novels went unpublished during his lifetime and the manuscripts have been lost or destroyed.</p>
<p>Fine: I would read all Dick’s novels that were there to be read. Some I’ve bought new, especially since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SF_Masterworks">SF Masterworks</a> series made so many of them available again. I keep an eye out for them in second-hand bookshops, too; recently I picked up a copy of a relatively early book, <em>The World Jones Made</em>. Last Christmas, a friend kindly bought me the beautiful <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/08/02/RVK418P8OB.DTL&amp;ao=all">Library of America</a> hardbacks, which also included some stories I hadn’t read yet.</p>
<p>All in all, I’ve now read 14 novels, from a total of 44. Here they are in chronological order.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The World Jones Made</em></li>
<li><em>Time Out of Joint</em></li>
<li><em>The Man in the High Castle</em></li>
<li><em>Martian Time-Slip</em></li>
<li><em>Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb</em></li>
<li><em>The Simulacra</em></li>
<li><em>Now Wait for Last Year</em></li>
<li><em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em></li>
<li><em>The Unteleported Man</em></li>
<li><em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em></li>
<li><em>Ubik</em></li>
<li><em>Galactic Pot-Healer</em></li>
<li><em>A Maze of Death</em></li>
<li><em>Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This page will be updated as I make further progress.</p>
