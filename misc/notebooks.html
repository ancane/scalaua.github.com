        <p>As with programming languages, I don’t write in just one kind of notebook. This page collates a few recommendations I would make to anyone with similar needs. I try to keep this page up to date with my current practices.</p>
<p>Be warned: fancy notebooks will not make you write better, and may even be detrimental to your writing process. A cheap spiral-bound supermarket notebook and a biro is probably a better choice than the options listed below, and will certainly be cheaper.</p>
<h2 id="legal-pads">Legal pads</h2>
<p>Yellow legal pads are perfect for taking notes on lectures and papers, as well as writing drafts of articles. I tend to use Cambridge pads, but that’s just because my local stationer stocks them.</p>
<h2 id="field-notes">Field Notes</h2>
<p><a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes</a> are classic memo books from <a href="http://coudal.com">Coudal</a>. I bought a pack on a whim, and haven’t looked back since. Slim, light and small, they accompany me most places.</p>
<h2 id="moleskine">Moleskine</h2>
<p>The classic pocket-sized hardback one (originally, of course, the only one they sold) is still a good notebook, albeit an expensive one: durable and well put together with excellent paper.</p>
<h2 id="rhodia">Rhodia</h2>
<p>The Bloc Rhodia № 16 with 5×5 mm graph paper is a superb development notebook. Layouts, lists, copy, code—they all jump off the crisp paper, and the detachable pages are the best I’ve used. Being <a href="http://rhodiadrive.com">bright orange</a>, they’re also quite hard to lose.</p>
<h2 id="pens-pencils">Pens &amp; pencils</h2>
<p>My pens of choice are black <a href="http://www.uniball.com/catalog/show/product.php?no=5">UB-150</a>s from the Mitsubishi Pencil Co., but lately I’ve been mainly writing with pencils. I really recommend the Field Notes ones: the cedar casing is wonderfully aromatic, and the graphite is dark. Because they’re unlaquered, they also feel great in the hand.</p>
<p>I also recommend Henry Petroski’s book <a href="http://www.pencilrevolution.com/2006/04/revolutionary-reading-the-pencil/"><em>The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance</em></a>. It’s a fascinating look at the story behind this humble, ubiquitous and utilitarian object.</p>
